# Story 2.6: Legacy Git Provider Cleanup

Status: review

## Story

As a developer,
I want the old per-provider Git code removed from the codebase,
So that the codebase reflects the current architecture without dead code.

## Context

Story 2.5 replaced `GitSource` with `VcsSource` and wired `VcsResolverInterface` to `GitVersionResolver`
(Story 2-5b). The old Git provider subsystem (`GitHubClient`, `AbstractGitProvider`, `GitProviderFactory`,
etc.) was unwired from `services.yaml` but left in place. `GenericGitResolver` was cancelled in Sprint
Change Proposal 2026-03-29c but also never deleted. `GitSource` (the old source class) still exists
alongside `VcsSource`. This story deletes all of it.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.5 + 2.5a + 2.5b complete, all tests green.

**Current state of the codebase (verified 2026-04-10):**
- `src/Infrastructure/Analyzer/VersionAvailability/Source/GitSource.php` — still exists, not wired in services.yaml
- `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitProvider/` — 5 files, not wired in services.yaml (unwired in 2.5)
- `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GenericGitResolver.php` — cancelled class, not wired, still on disk
- `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitRepositoryAnalyzer.php` — not wired (removed from VcsSource in 2.5)
- `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitRepositoryHealth.php`, `GitRepositoryInfo.php`, `GitRepositoryMetadata.php`, `GitTag.php`, `GitVersionParser.php`, `GitAnalysisException.php` — orphaned support classes
- `config/services.yaml` lines 227–250: explicit entries for `GitProviderFactory`, `GitHubClient`, `GitRepositoryAnalyzer`, `GitVersionParser` — must be removed
- `src/Infrastructure/Repository/RepositoryUrlHandler.php` / `RepositoryUrlHandlerInterface.php` — still **actively used** by `PackagistClient` — **DO NOT DELETE**
- `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitVersionResolver.php` — the **new** resolver from Story 2-5b — **DO NOT DELETE**

## Dev Notes

### Critical: Do NOT Delete These Files

The following files have names that look like the git provider subsystem but are **not** legacy code:

| File | Reason to keep |
|------|----------------|
| `src/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitVersionResolver.php` | Created in Story 2-5b — the current VCS resolver |
| `tests/Unit/Infrastructure/ExternalTool/GitVersionResolverTest.php` | Test for the current VCS resolver |
| `src/Infrastructure/Repository/RepositoryUrlHandler.php` | Used by `PackagistClient` — active code |
| `src/Infrastructure/Repository/RepositoryUrlHandlerInterface.php` | Interface for `RepositoryUrlHandler` |

### Deletion Strategy

This story is pure deletion — no new code written. The safe approach:

1. Run the grep in Task 1 first. Abort if any surviving source file (outside the deletion list) imports a class to be deleted.
2. Delete files in order: source files first, then test files, then config.
3. Run `composer test` after each batch of deletions to catch problems early.
4. If PHPStan complains about a reference you missed, grep for the FQCN and clean it up.

### services.yaml: Exact Blocks to Remove

From `config/services.yaml` (approximately lines 227–251):

```yaml
  CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitProvider\GitProviderFactory:
    arguments:
      $providers:
        - '@CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitProvider\GitHubClient'

  CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitProvider\GitHubClient:
    arguments:
      - ...
      - '@CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\Repository\RepositoryUrlHandlerInterface'

  CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitRepositoryAnalyzer:
    arguments:
      - '@CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitProvider\GitProviderFactory'
      - '@CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitVersionParser'

  CPSIT\UpgradeAnalyzer\Infrastructure\ExternalTool\GitVersionParser: ~
```

The `RepositoryUrlHandlerInterface` alias and the `RepositoryUrlHandler` service entries **above** these blocks (lines ~54–57, 72) must **not** be removed — they serve `PackagistClient`.

### GenericGitResolver Note

`GenericGitResolver` was cancelled in Sprint Change Proposal 2026-03-29c (git archive --remote non-functional on hosted git services). The file was never removed from the codebase. The class still implements `VcsResolverInterface` — it was updated in Story 2-5b only to match the new interface signature. No active consumer. Safe to delete.

### GitSource Note

`GitSource` was the pre-2.5 VCS source. It was replaced by `VcsSource` in Story 2.5. It is no longer tagged in `services.yaml` (unwired in 2.5). It still exists on disk. The file and its test (`GitSourceTest.php`) are dead code.

### Testing Patterns (for reference, no new tests written in this story)

- PHPUnit ^12.5 attributes: `#[CoversClass]`, `#[Test]`, `#[DataProvider]`
- No `test` prefix on methods
- `self::assertEquals()` not `$this->`

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Notes

Pure deletion story. All 14 source files and 10+ test files removed without touching any surviving code.

Additional scope beyond AC-6: integration test files also referenced deleted classes and required cleanup:
- `tests/Integration/ExternalTool/GitRepositoryIntegrationTestTest.php` — deleted (entire file was for deleted subsystem)
- `tests/Helper/validate_git_simple.php` — deleted (helper script for deleted subsystem)
- `tests/Integration/AbstractIntegrationTestCase.php` — removed 3 helper methods (`assertGitRepositoryHealthValid`, `assertGitRepositoryMetadataValid`, `assertGitTagsValid`) and their imports
- `tests/Integration/PerformanceReliabilityTestCase.php` — removed git client instantiation and `GitSource` from both `testDiverseNetworkConditions()` and `createAnalyzer()`; analyzer still functional with TER + Packagist sources

All ACs satisfied. Quality gate: 1676 tests pass, PHPStan Level 8 clean, lint clean.

## Overview

The TYPO3 Upgrade Analyzer is a comprehensive tool that evaluates TYPO3 installations externally without requiring installation into the target system. It provides objective risk measures and effort estimates through automated analysis.

## Features

- **Standalone Operation**: Operates completely independently of target TYPO3 installation
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Works with TYPO3 versions 6.x through 13.x
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Multiple analyzer types for thorough evaluation
- **Multiple Output Formats**: HTML and Markdown reports
- **Clean Architecture**: Follows clean architecture principles with strict separation of concerns
- **Modular Analyzer System**: Dynamic analyzer discovery with pluggable implementations
- **Advanced Static Analysis**: Integrates TYPO3 Rector and Fractor for code modernization analysis
- **External API Integration**: Checks TYPO3 Extension Repository, Packagist, and Git repositories
- **Caching Support**: Built-in caching for improved performance on repeated analyses

## Requirements

- **PHP 8.3** or higher
- **Composer** for dependency management
- **External Tools** (automatically managed via Composer):
  - `ssch/typo3-rector` for TYPO3-specific code analysis
  - `a9f/typo3-fractor` for TypoScript modernization
  - Network access for external API calls (TER, Packagist, GitHub)

## Installation

### Via Composer (Recommended)

```bash
# For development/local use
composer require --dev cpsit/typo3-upgrade-analyser

# For global installation
composer global require cpsit/typo3-upgrade-analyser
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cpsit/typo3-upgrade-analyser.git
cd typo3-upgrade-analyser
composer install
```

## Quick Start

1. **Create Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/typo3-analyzer init-config
   ```

2. **Analyze TYPO3 Installation**:
   ```bash
   ./bin/typo3-analyzer analyze
   ```

3. **View Results**: Check the `var/reports/` directory for HTML and Markdown reports.

For detailed usage instructions, see the **[Usage Guide](documentation/USAGE.md)**.

## Available Analyzers

### Currently Implemented

- **Version Availability Analyzer** (`version_availability`)
  - Checks extension compatibility across TER, Packagist, and Git repositories
  - Analyzes version constraints and upgrade paths
  - Provides risk scoring based on availability

- **TYPO3 Rector Analyzer** (`typo3_rector`)
  - Uses `ssch/typo3-rector` for TYPO3-specific code analysis
  - Detects deprecated API usage and required migrations
  - Provides automated refactoring suggestions

- **Fractor Analyzer** (`fractor`)
  - Uses `a9f/typo3-fractor` for TypoScript modernization
  - Analyzes TypoScript patterns and suggests improvements
  - Detects outdated TypoScript syntax

- **Lines of Code Analyzer** (`lines_of_code`)
  - Counts total lines of code, comments, and blank lines
  - Calculates code complexity metrics
  - Provides maintenance effort estimates

### Analyzer Features

- **Dynamic Discovery**: All analyzers are automatically discovered and registered
- **Caching Support**: Results are cached to improve performance on repeated runs
- **Configurable**: Each analyzer can be enabled/disabled and configured independently
- **Extensible**: New analyzers can be added by implementing `AnalyzerInterface`

## Output Structure

The analyzer creates a comprehensive output structure in the configured output directory:

```
var/
â”œâ”€â”€ log/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ typo3-upgrade-analyzer.log      # Detailed execution logs
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ html/                  # HTML reports with interactive features

â”‚           â””â”€â”€ extension2.md
â”œâ”€â”€ results/                   # Cached analysis results
â””â”€â”€ temp/                      # Temporary files (Rector/Fractor configs)
```

### Report Contents

- **Main Report**: High-level overview with summary statistics and risk assessment
- **Detailed Report**: Comprehensive analysis results for each extension including:
  - Version availability across repositories
  - Code quality metrics and complexity
  - Required migrations and refactoring opportunities
  - Risk scores and upgrade recommendations

## Development

### Requirements

- **PHP 8.3** or higher
- **Composer** for dependency management
- **Git** for version control

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cpsit/typo3-upgrade-analyser.git
cd typo3-upgrade-analyser
composer install
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Testing
composer test              # Run unit tests only (fast)
composer test:unit         # Run unit tests
composer test:integration  # Run integration tests
composer test:functional   # Run functional tests
